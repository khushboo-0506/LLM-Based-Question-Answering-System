            "## World Day of Social Justice – Rs. 13,611 crore allocated to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in Union Budget 2025-26\n",
            "The World Day of Social Justice is observed on February 20 by the United Nations to promote efforts in addressing poverty, exclusion, and unemployment while fostering solidarity and equality of opportunity across societies. This year’s theme emphasises the role of governments and global institutions in tackling social injustice and promoting fairness.\n",
            "**India’s role in Social Justice initiatives**\n",
            "Aligned with the global mission of the World Day of Social Justice, India’s Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE) has been working on bridging socio-economic disparities through legislative reforms, grassroots initiatives, and international collaborations. Over the years, India has strengthened its commitment to empowering marginalized communities and upholding justice for all citizens.\n",
            "Since its inception in 2009, the World Day of Social Justice has served as a global reminder of the interconnection between social justice and peace. With rising economic inequalities and challenges in global security, the importance of social justice initiatives becomes ever more critical. This is further supported by the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) efforts, which promote social justice through their Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization.\n",
            "**Key Social Justice Programs in India**\n",
            "India’s journey toward achieving social justice is deeply rooted in its constitutional mandates, which lay a strong foundation for ensuring equality, dignity, and justice, particularly for disadvantaged communities. The MoSJE’s recent initiatives, such as PM-AJAY, NAMASTE, SMILE, PM-DAKSH Yojana, and the Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan, highlight India’s focus on creating opportunities for marginalized groups through education, skills development, and economic empowerment.\n",
            "The MoSJE has also prioritized the empowerment of vulnerable groups, including Scheduled Castes (SCs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Transgender Persons, and individuals engaged in begging, through a series of social protection measures and welfare programs. Additionally, the government has expanded its budget allocation, reflecting its continued focus on fostering justice and inclusion.\n",
            "Through programs such as SRESHTA (Scheme for Residential Education for Students in High Schools in Targeted Areas) and Purple Fests, the MoSJE has ensured that marginalized communities gain access to quality education and platforms for social inclusion. The NAMASTE scheme has also been crucial in providing sustainable livelihoods to sanitation workers, while SMILE continues to work towards rehabilitating transgender individuals and persons engaged in begging.\n",
            "As the country observes the World Day of Social Justice, these efforts reaffirm India’s dedication to addressing socio-economic gaps and ensuring dignity, justice, and equal opportunity for all its citizens.\n",

She said 27 patients had died at medical colleges and many at home due to the cease-work of the junior doctors.\n",
            "Earlier, the proposed meeting between the doctors and the state government failed to take place twice on Tuesday and Wednesday because of dissidence. The junior doctors have been sitting in front of the Swasthya Bhawan, the state headquarters of the health department, since Tuesday, demanding the resignation of the health secretary, director of health, and director of health education of the state, as well as justice for the victim.\n",

            "Members of the Hong Kong and Uyghur communities in Ireland have called on the Irish government to address China’s transnational repression and human rights violations during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to Dublin.\n",
            "Wang, who is also a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo, arrived in Ireland after attending the Munich Security Conference, where he met with top European leaders. He is scheduled to hold discussions with Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Simon Harris, The Irish Times reported.\n",
            "In a joint statement, organizations representing Uyghurs and Hongkongers in Ireland urged the government to take concrete action against China’s repression, including allegations of genocide, politically motivated imprisonment, and harassment of diaspora communities.\n",
            "The groups raised concerns over Chinese government surveillance and intimidation of dissidents on Irish soil, warning that these activities pose a direct threat to Ireland’s national security.\n",
            "“We do not feel we can openly exercise our right to protest for fear of retribution by the regime—whether against our family members back home, within Ireland itself, or by losing our chance to visit our homelands,” the statement read, as quoted by The Irish Times.\n",
            "They highlighted that the European Union has acknowledged China’s pattern of transnational repression, particularly targeting Tibetan, Taiwanese, Hongkonger, and Uyghur communities.\n",
            "The statement also referenced a recent case where Hong Kong authorities detained the relatives of an exiled activist to punish her for participating in a legal protest in London. Such incidents, the groups said, have created a climate of fear among diasporic Hongkongers in Ireland and beyond.\n",
            "The European Hong Kong Diaspora Alliance, the Irish Uyghur Cultural Association, and Stand With Hong Kong urged the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to raise these concerns with Wang, emphasizing that diplomatic ties and economic relations should not come at the cost of fundamental freedoms.\n",
            "“People in Ireland have a right to live free from fear,” the statement added.\n",
            "Wang Yi’s visit marks the second high-profile Chinese delegation to Ireland in just over a year, following Premier Li Qiang’s trip in January 2024.\n",
            "China’s foreign ministry, announcing the visit last week, described Ireland as a “strategic partner for mutually beneficial cooperation,” saying that bilateral ties have maintained “sound growth momentum.”\n",

            "Hours after taking the oath as Delhi’s Chief Minister, Rekha Gupta chaired her first cabinet meeting, announcing key decisions that set the tone for her government. Among the first orders of business was the implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi, with a ₹5 lakh top-up provided by the state government. Additionally, she confirmed that her government would table the 14 pending Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) reports in the Assembly’s first sitting, a move that the previous AAP-led government had failed to execute.\n",
            "Addressing a press conference following the meeting, Gupta emphasized that these steps reflected the BJP’s commitment to fulfilling its election promises. She reiterated that her government would sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Centre to execute the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi, ensuring that the state government would cover the additional financial burden. \n",
            "Alongside these major policy announcements, Gupta also allocated portfolios to her council of ministers. As Chief Minister, she has retained key departments, including General Administration, Services, Finance, Revenue, Women and Child Development, Land and Building, Information and Public Relations, Vigilance, Administrative Reforms, Planning, and all other departments not assigned to specific ministers.\n",
            "BJP MLA Pravesh Verma has been entrusted with the Public Works Department (PWD), Legislative Affairs, Irrigation and Flood Control, Water, and Gurdwara Elections, while Ashish Sood will handle Home, Power, Urban Development, Education, Higher Education, and Technical Training. Manjinder Singh Sirsa has been given charge of Food and Supplies, Forest and Environment, and Industries, while Ravinder Singh (Indraj) will oversee Social Welfare, SC and ST Welfare, Cooperative, and Elections.\n",
            "Kapil Mishra, a prominent BJP leader, will be responsible for Law and Justice, Labour, Employment, Art and Culture, Language, and Tourism, while Pankaj Kumar Singh will lead the Health and Family Welfare, Transport, and Information Technology departments.\n",
            "In a symbolic first public appearance after the cabinet meeting, Rekha Gupta and her ministers attended the evening Aarti on the banks of the Yamuna. Addressing the gathering, she reaffirmed her government’s commitment to cleaning the river, describing it as a top priority for her administration.\n",
